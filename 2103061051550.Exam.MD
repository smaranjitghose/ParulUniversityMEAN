Git is a free and open-source version control system that's widely used for tracking changes in code. It's especially popular for collaborative software development projects. Here are some of its key features:

Version control: Git keeps track of every change made to your code, allowing you to revert to previous versions if needed. This is like having a history book for your project.
Distributed: Unlike older version control systems, Git doesn't rely on a central server. Each developer has a complete copy of the project history on their machine. This makes collaboration easier and more flexible.
Branching: Git allows you to create branches of your codebase. This lets you experiment with new features or bug fixes without affecting the main code. When you're happy with your changes, you can merge the branch back into the main codebase.
Staging area: Git lets you stage specific changes before committing them. This gives you more control over what gets included in each version of your code.
Speed and efficiency: Git is known for its speed and efficiency, even for large projects.
